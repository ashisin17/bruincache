## What is BruinCache
A web application with a map of pinned locations with clues that are meant to lead the user to hidden bruincaches sites placed around UCLA. Once the bruincache site is found, users will find a passcode that can be used on the web application to verify that they have found the site. They may also replace the bruincache that they find and/or write their name in the logbook of people that have previously visited the bruincache site. The web applications will require users to make a profile to log the bruincaches theyâ€™ve already found or post their own hidden bruincaches. Once users use the passcode to verify they have found the bruincache, they are able to leave a comment and see comments that other users have left.
